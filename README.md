# Code of Conduct - Group 2 

A code of conduct is a vital component for a computer practitioner in their day to day activities. This gives them an idea of the rules of computing, but it is not always as simple as that, as their own judgement is required to know what is allowed and what is not. 

Below are the attributes that we feel are vital to our group working together smoothly and effectively.  

## 1.	Obligation to Society

-	Be honest and trustworthy.
-	Respect each team memberâ€™s opinion whether or not you agree.

## 2. Reporting Misconduct

- Any member of the team can be fired after multiple warnings for not adhering to the Code of Conduct set.
- That person will have the opportunity to evidence mitigating circumstances either to the team or privately to a lecturer.
- Do not take responsibility or credit for any work that is not yours.

## 3. General Conduct

- Attend daily meetings and the lab each week and alert the team if you are not able to attend.
- Work as hard and productively as you can - Do not allow one person to do the majority of the work.
- But do not try and do all the work by yourself as each team member must contribute.
- Make a conscious effort to get along with the team.

Not following the Code of Conduct set by our team can result in any member being fired - which in worst case - can result in that induvidual failing this module.
